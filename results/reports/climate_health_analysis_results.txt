RIGOROUS CLIMATE-HEALTH ANALYSIS RESULTS
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
------------------------------
• Educational attainment shows differential patterns of climate exposure across 4 education levels (n = 5,717)
• Geographic clustering reveals spatial patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability and differential climate exposure across African urban areas

METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS:
------------------------------
• Rigorous separation of clinical and socioeconomic cohorts prevents data leakage
• Comprehensive lag structure captures acute and delayed climate health effects
• Cross-validation ensures robust model performance estimates
• Sex-stratified analysis identifies differential climate vulnerabilities
• Ecological aggregation enables neighborhood-level inference
• Geographic clustering accounts for spatial autocorrelation

LIMITATIONS:
------------------------------
• Biomarker data available for 42.2% of clinical cohort
• Limited temperature data availability in socioeconomic cohort
• Limited variation in housing_vulnerability (only 1 unique values)
• Limited variation in economic_vulnerability (only 2 unique values)
• Cross-sectional design limits causal inference
• Residual confounding from unmeasured environmental factors
• Ecological fallacy in neighborhood-level aggregations

RECOMMENDATIONS:
------------------------------
• Expand biomarker collection to achieve >80% coverage across cohorts
• Implement longitudinal follow-up to establish temporal relationships
• Enhance vulnerability indices with continuous measurement scales
• Integrate air quality data for multi-pollutant exposure models
• Develop adaptive monitoring systems for real-time climate-health surveillance
• Establish individual-level linkage between clinical and socioeconomic data
