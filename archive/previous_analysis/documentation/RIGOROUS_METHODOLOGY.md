# Rigorous Climate-Health Machine Learning Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document presents a scientifically rigorous methodology for climate-health machine learning that eliminates data leakage and produces realistic, publication-ready results. The previous analysis showed artificially inflated R² scores (CD4: 0.49, BP: 0.99+) due to data contamination. This new methodology addresses these critical issues.

## Problem Statement

**Previous Issues:**
- Massive data leakage from using biomarkers as predictors for other biomarkers
- Temporal data leakage from improper train/test splits
- Overfitted models with unrealistic hyperparameters
- Performance metrics that are impossible in real climate-health research

**Expected Realistic Performance:**
- Individual biomarkers: R² 0.02-0.15
- Strong climate effects: R² 0.10-0.20  
- Ensemble effects: R² 0.20-0.30 maximum
- Anything >0.30 indicates likely data leakage

## Core Methodology Components

### 1. Strict Feature Selection (No Data Leakage)

**ALLOWED FEATURES ONLY:**
```python
# Climate variables (exogenous)
- Temperature: temp_*, tas_*, apparent_temp_*
- Heat stress: heat_index_*, utci_*, wbgt_*
- Wind: wind_*, ws_*
- Derived climate: cooling_degree_days, heat_exposure_days

# Demographics (basic only)
- Sex, Race, latitude, longitude
- Temporal: year, month, season, day_of_year

# Lag features (0-21 days)
- All climate variables with proper lag structure
```

**STRICTLY EXCLUDED:**
```python
# Health-derived variables
- Any biomarker predicting another biomarker
- Vulnerability indices derived from health outcomes
- Employment/education status (potential health proxy)
- Infrastructure indices (potential health proxy)
- Any "status" or "profile" variables
```

### 2. Temporal Validation Framework

**Proper Time-Aware Splits:**
```python
# NO random splitting - respects temporal order
train_data: earliest 60% of timeline
validation_data: middle 20% of timeline  
test_data: latest 20% of timeline

# Temporal gaps to prevent leakage
gap_days = 30  # Buffer between train/test
```

**Cross-Validation Strategies:**
- **Temporal Blocked CV**: Forward-chaining with gaps
- **Seasonal CV**: Train on 3 seasons, test on 1
- **Spatial CV**: Geographic leave-one-cluster-out
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Bootstrap confidence intervals

### 3. Conservative Model Configuration

**Hyperparameters (Prevent Overfitting):**
```python
# Random Forest (Conservative)
RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,        # Not 250
    max_depth=5,             # Not 15
    min_samples_split=20,    # Not 10
    min_samples_leaf=10,     # Not 5
    max_features='sqrt'      # Conservative feature sampling
)

# XGBoost (Conservative)  
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,        # Not 200
    max_depth=3,             # Not 8  
    learning_rate=0.1,       # Not 0.05
    reg_alpha=0.1,           # Strong L1 regularization
    reg_lambda=1.0           # Strong L2 regularization
)
```

### 4. Performance Assessment Framework

**Literature-Based Categories:**
```python
performance_expectations = {
    'weak_climate_effect': (0.001, 0.02),     # Minimal climate influence
    'modest_climate_effect': (0.02, 0.05),    # Detectable climate signal  
    'moderate_climate_effect': (0.05, 0.10),  # Moderate climate influence
    'strong_climate_effect': (0.10, 0.20),    # Strong climate influence
    'very_strong_climate_effect': (0.20, 0.30), # Very strong (rare)
    'suspiciously_high': (0.30, 1.0)          # Likely data leakage
}
```

**Confidence Intervals:**
- Bootstrap resampling (n=100) on test set
- 95% confidence intervals for all metrics
- Statistical significance testing between models

### 5. Interpretability Framework

**SHAP Analysis:**
```python
# Feature importance decomposition
- Global feature importance (mean |SHAP|)
- Individual prediction explanations
- Feature interaction analysis

# Climate-specific insights
- Lag pattern analysis (which days matter most)
- Climate variable group importance
- Geographic and seasonal effect patterns
```

**Publication-Ready Visualizations:**
- SHAP summary plots
- Lag importance patterns
- Climate variable group analysis
- Model performance across CV strategies
