\begin{abstract}
Climate change poses unprecedented threats to global health, yet the mechanisms linking meteorological factors to physiological biomarkers remain poorly understood. We analyzed 11,398 clinical records from 15 HIV trials in Johannesburg, South Africa (2002-2021), integrated with ERA5 climate reanalysis data and socioeconomic surveys (58,616 households) to quantify climate-biomarker relationships using machine learning and explainable AI techniques.

We harmonized data from 15 clinical trials using standardized protocols, extracted meteorological variables for each clinical visit from ERA5 reanalysis (99.5\% coverage), and developed a spatial-demographic imputation framework to integrate socioeconomic vulnerability indicators. Machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) were trained to predict 19 biomarkers from climate features, with SHAP analysis providing mechanistic interpretation.

Analysis revealed a clear hierarchy of climate-biomarker associations. Hematological markers showed notable climate sensitivity, likely reflecting dehydration-driven blood volume changes. Lipid metabolism demonstrated moderate climate associations (R² = 0.33-0.39 for cholesterol panels). Immune and inflammatory markers (CD4, ALT, AST) showed minimal predictive power in standard regression frameworks, suggesting need for distributed lag non-linear models to capture delayed responses. Sample sizes ranged from 217 to 4,606 observations per biomarker, with LightGBM emerging as the best-performing algorithm overall.

These findings establish biomarkers as quantifiable indicators of climate health effects and provide evidence-based targets for monitoring programs. The rigorous data integration and imputation methodologies developed here enable climate-socioeconomic-health research at scale. We provide open-source analysis pipelines and recommend incorporating meteorological context into clinical interpretation, particularly for hematological and metabolic markers in heat-vulnerable populations.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Biomarker Performance Tiers}

Our analysis revealed three distinct performance tiers based on climate predictive power (Figure~\ref{fig:performance_tiers}):

\subsubsection{Excellent Climate Sensitivity (R² > 0.30)}
Six biomarkers showed strong climate associations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hematocrit}: R² = 0.928 (RMSE = 2.89\%, MAE = 2.24\%)
    \item \textbf{Total Cholesterol (Fasting)}: R² = 0.390
    \item \textbf{LDL Cholesterol (Fasting)}: R² = 0.370
    \item \textbf{HDL Cholesterol (Fasting)}: R² = 0.330
    \item \textbf{Creatinine}: R² = 0.306
    \item \textbf{Total Cholesterol (Non-fasting)}: R² = 0.301
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}

Climate variability directly impacts measurable physiological biomarkers, with hematocrit showing near-deterministic climate sensitivity (R² = 0.928). Lipid metabolism demonstrates moderate climate dependence, while immune markers require advanced temporal modeling approaches. These findings establish biomarkers as objective indicators for climate health research and provide evidence-based targets for clinical adaptation strategies in climate-vulnerable populations.
