## How to Frame Explainable AI as Your Novel Approach

### The Story Arc:
1. **Problem**: Traditional epidemiological methods may miss complex, non-linear climate-health relationships
2. **Solution**: Explainable AI provides a systematic way to explore the full feature space
3. **Innovation**: Your approach uses XAI not just for prediction, but for discovery
4. **Impact**: Identifies previously hidden patterns, vulnerable groups, and intervention opportunities

### Key Talking Points:

**What Makes Your XAI Approach Novel:**
- **Feature Discovery**: Using SHAP values to identify unexpected important variables
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: XAI reveals optimal lag periods automatically
- **Interaction Detection**: Discovers complex climate × SES × health interactions
- **Vulnerability Mapping**: Feature importance varies across population subgroups
- **Intervention Windows**: XAI identifies when climate impacts are strongest

**The XAI Methods You're Using:**
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for feature importance
- Partial dependence plots for non-linear relationships
- Interaction analysis through feature combinations
- Stratified model interpretability across SES groups
- Temporal importance evolution across lag periods

### Slide Flow Incorporating XAI:

1. **Traditional Approach Limitations**
   - Linear assumptions miss complex relationships
   - Pre-specified models may overlook important features
   - Black box ML lacks interpretability

2. **XAI as Discovery Tool**
   - Systematic exploration of 100+ climate variables
   - Automatic identification of important lag periods
   - Discovery of unexpected biomarker responses

3. **Your Findings Through XAI Lens**
   - SHAP reveals cardiovascular lag-21 importance
   - Feature interactions show SES amplifies heat effects
   - Model explanations guide intervention strategies

4. **Future Implications**
   - XAI as standard tool for climate-health research
   - Personalized risk assessment through interpretable models
   - Policy guidance from explainable predictions
