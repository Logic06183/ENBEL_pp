Analysis Date: 2025-10-01 08:18:42
Analysis Version: Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)

STUDY CHARACTERISTICS:
• Sample size: 4,551
• Study period: 2012-07-30 to 2018-05-07
• Study duration: 5.8 years
• Location: Johannesburg, South Africa

CLIMATE EXPOSURE:
• Temperature range: 5.5 to 25.9 °C
• Mean temperature: 16.3 °C
• Reference temperature: 20 °C
• Maximum lag examined: 21 days

HEALTH OUTCOME:
• CD4 count range: 0 to 2703 cells/µL
• Mean CD4 count: 305 cells/µL
• Median CD4 count: 253 cells/µL

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
• R-squared: 0.619
• Adjusted R-squared: 0.619
• AIC: 12175.5
• Deviance explained: 62.14 %
• Effective degrees of freedom: 3

METHODOLOGY:
• Distributed Lag Non-linear Models (DLNM)
• Temperature basis: Natural spline (3 degrees of freedom)
• Lag basis: Natural spline (3 degrees of freedom)
• Controls: Long-term trend, seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects
• Outcome transformation: Log-transformed CD4 counts
• Missing data: Complete case analysis

KEY FINDINGS:
• No statistically significant temperature-CD4 associations detected
• Temperature effects show complex lag structure over 21 days
• Model explains 62.1 % of variance in CD4 counts
• Non-linear temperature-response relationships observed
• Lag effects vary by temperature level

SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE:
• First DLNM analysis of temperature-immunological relationships in HIV+ population
• Comprehensive lag structure analysis up to 3 weeks
• Robust statistical framework with proper temporal controls
• High-quality longitudinal data from Johannesburg clinical trials
