### Task 2.1: GCRO Dataset Inspection ‚úÖ
**Status:** Complete
**Critical Finding:** Wave-specific data collection patterns

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ 58,616 records (matches expected)
- 90 features
- 4 survey waves: 2011, 2014, 2018, 2021
- 508 wards (full Gauteng province)
- 63.79% overall missingness

**Completeness Patterns Discovered:**
| Pattern | Features | Explanation |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 100% | 8 | Metadata, coordinates, dates |
| 51.2% | 1 | Ward (multi-wave) |
| 25.6% | ~35 | **2011 wave only** (15,000/58,616 = 25.6%) |
| 23.2% | ~15 | **2018 or 2021 wave** |
| <10% | ~30 | Specific questionnaire items |

### Task 2.2: Socioeconomic Feature Selection ‚úÖ
**Status:** Complete (major revision)
**Critical Finding:** 2018 wave superior to 2011!

**Initial Assumption (WRONG):**
- Assumed 2011 wave had rich socioeconomic data
- Based on 25.6% completeness pattern

**Systematic Investigation:**
- Checked feature availability across ALL 4 waves
- **Discovery:** 2018 wave has 18 high-quality features at 100% completeness
- 2011 wave missing: income, age, vulnerability indices, infrastructure

**Wave-by-Wave Comparison:**

| Feature Category | 2011 | 2014 | 2018 | 2021 | Best Wave |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|-----------|
| Age | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Income (18 categories) | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Education | 96.6% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Economic vulnerability | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Education adaptive capacity | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Age vulnerability | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Drainage infrastructure | 0% | 0% | 100% | 0% | **2018** ‚≠ê |
| Race | 100% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **2011** |
| Employment status | 99.2% | 0% | 0% | 0% | **2011** |

**Revised Strategy: Use 2018 Wave + Race from 2011**

13. `dwelling_count` (number of dwellings, continuous)

**Infrastructure (1):**
14. `Q2_14_Drainage` (drainage type, 6 categories)

**From 2011 Wave (1 feature):**
15. `std_race` (race/ethnicity, 4 categories) - import via ward-level spatial join

### Task 2.3: Spatial Matching Quality ‚è≥ PENDING

## Overall Feature Space Summary

### Current Status

| Feature Category | Count | Coverage | Source |
|------------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Climate | 6 | 99.4% | ERA5 reanalysis (validated) |
| Temporal | 2 | 100% | Derived from dates |
| Socioeconomic (2018) | 14 | 100% | GCRO 2018 wave |
| Socioeconomic (2011) | 1 | TBD | GCRO 2011 (race via spatial join) |
| **TOTAL** | **23** | **>99%** | |

### Before vs After Phase 1

| Metric | Initial Plan | After Phase 1 | Change |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Climate features | 16 | 6 | -10 (prioritized quality) |
| Climate coverage | 84% | 99.4% | +15.4% (gained 1,809 records) |
| Socioeconomic features | 14 (from ?) | 15 (2018+2011) | +1 (discovered optimal source) |
| Socioeconomic source | Unclear | 2018 wave | Systematic investigation |
| Total features | ~39 | 23 | -16 (quality > quantity) |
| Records retained | 9,589 (84%) | 11,398 (100%) | +1,809 (+15.87%) |
| SES measurement | Unknown | Income, age, 3 vulnerability indices | Major improvement |

## Key Methodological Decisions

### Decision 1: Climate Features - Option A (Core Features Only)
**Rationale:**
- Data quality > feature quantity
- Validated features only (no questionable recomputation)
- Maintain full sample size (statistical power)
- Literature precedent for simpler feature sets

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Gain: 1,809 records (+15.87%), 99.4% coverage
- ‚úÖ Gain: High data quality (validated core features)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loss: 10 derived features (lags, anomalies, thresholds)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mitigation: Core features capture essential variation, can model lags with DLNM

### Decision 2: GCRO Wave - Use 2018 (Not 2011)
**Rationale:**
- Comprehensive SES measurement (income, age, vulnerability indices)
- 100% completeness for all 14 features
- More recent data (better for 2015-2021 clinical records)
- Climate justice alignment (vulnerability indicators)

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚úÖ Gain: Income (18 categories), age (11 groups), 3 vulnerability indices
- ‚úÖ Gain: 100% completeness (vs 96.6% education in 2011)
- ‚úÖ Gain: Better SES characterization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Loss: Direct heat vulnerability index (can compute from components)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complexity: Need race from 2011 via spatial join
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mitigation: Ward-level race relatively stable 2011-2018
