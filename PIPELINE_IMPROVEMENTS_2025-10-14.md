- Provides proof-of-concept for methodology

### Challenges Identified: CD4, ALT, AST 🔴
- **Negative R² scores** (-0.003 to -0.10)
- Models perform worse than baseline
- **Root Cause:** Need advanced techniques (DLNM, better features)

## Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Priority 1: Immediate Actions 🔥

1. **Implement DLNM for CD4**

   - Capture lagged climate effects
   - 4,606 samples available

2. **Merge GCRO Socioeconomic Data**
   - Add household vulnerability indices
   - Include income, education, dwelling type
   - Hypothesis: SES moderates climate effects

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - Implement Optuna trials (already in code, just needs activation)
   - Expected: +5-15% R² boost

### Priority 2: Medium-Term 🟡

4. **Advanced Feature Engineering**
   - Interaction terms (temp × season)
   - Cumulative metrics (heat wave duration)
   - Polynomial features

5. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Stack multiple models
   - Meta-learner for final predictions

6. **Expand to All Biomarkers**
   - Analyze remaining 14 biomarkers
   - Focus on glucose, lipids, blood pressure

### Priority 3: Long-Term 💡

7. **Causal Inference**
   - Propensity score matching
   - Control for confounders

8. **Spatial Analysis**
   - Urban heat island effects
   - Green space proximity

9. **Temporal Dynamics**
   - Time-series decomposition
   - Climate projections

cd "/Users/craig/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/ENBEL_pp"
python scripts/pipelines/refined_analysis_pipeline.py
```

### With Custom Parameters
```python
from scripts.pipelines.refined_analysis_pipeline import RefinedClimateHealthPipeline

pipeline = RefinedClimateHealthPipeline(
    data_path="data/raw",

)
pipeline.run()
```

## Comparison to Previous Pipelines

| Feature | Old Pipelines | Refined Pipeline |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Runtime | Variable | 8.4s (5 biomarkers) |
| Documentation | Minimal | Comprehensive |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Not All Biomarkers Are Equal**
   - Hematocrit: Highly predictable (R² = 0.93)
   - CD4: Requires advanced methods (current R² negative)
   - Lesson: Screen biomarkers early to focus efforts

2. **Default Models Aren't Enough**
   - Default hyperparameters performed poorly for most biomarkers
   - Need systematic optimization (Optuna)

3. **Feature Engineering Is Critical**
   - Current climate features insufficient for CD4/ALT/AST
   - Need DLNM for lagged effects
   - Need socioeconomic features for confounding control

4. **Sample Size Matters**
   - Creatinine clearance (217 samples) too small
   - CD4 (4,606 samples) ideal for analysis
   - Rule of thumb: Need >1,000 complete cases

## Future Enhancements Planned

### Code Improvements
- [ ] Add Optuna hyperparameter optimization toggle
- [ ] Implement time-series aware cross-validation
- [ ] Add ensemble stacking functionality
- [ ] Create visualization dashboard
- [ ] Add model comparison plots

### Analysis Expansions
- [ ] Run full 19-biomarker analysis
- [ ] Merge GCRO socioeconomic data
- [ ] Implement DLNM in Python (or R integration)
- [ ] Add spatial analysis features
- [ ] Create interactive reports

### Documentation
- [ ] Add API documentation
- [ ] Create usage tutorials
- [ ] Write methodology paper outline
- [ ] Generate supplementary materials

## Conclusion

Successfully created and executed a refined, reproducible climate-health analysis pipeline. While results are mixed (excellent for Hematocrit, poor for CD4/ALT/AST), we now have:

1. **A solid foundation** for systematic analysis
2. **Clear understanding** of what works and what doesn't
3. **Prioritized roadmap** for improvements
4. **Reproducible methodology** for future work

**Next Immediate Action:** Implement DLNM for CD4 analysis to capture lagged climate effects.
